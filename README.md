Primary tasks (required):

- inverse kinematics (move end effector to a desired Cartesian pose)
- movement with desired translational and rotational velocity
- plan and make robot follow Cartesian trajectories
- read, write and visualise joint angles
- read, compute, write and plot Cartesian positions (FK) and Euler angles of robot links
- read, write and compute Jacobian matrices (week)
- be able to move the robot with some controls

Report (5-10 pages):

- what our work simulates
- what and how was theoretical material used for developing our simulation
- what's good bout our simulation and any real applications
- data, graphs, numbers, results etc about or simulations
